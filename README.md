# graphQL-mindmap
## A mindmap for finding, testing and exploiting graphQL vulnerabilities for remedation.

 This is a mindmap using the xmind app for a visual walkthrough and checklist for GraphQL testing.  Xmind is a free app with paid addons but it is completely usable in the free form.
 You can get your copy here. https://xmind.app/

 A lot of the ideas/material is condendsed information from the great resource book Black Hat GraphQL (2023) by Dolev Farhi, Nick Aleks @dolevf @nicholasaleks  
 You can find the book here or when it shows up in humble bundles.  https://nostarch.com/black-hat-graphql
 
 They have a github companion to the book with a lot of tools, resources and information which is super helpful.
 Give it a star and follow here https://github.com/dolevf/Black-Hat-GraphQL

 ### This mindmap is a work in progress as I go through the book and encounter GraphQL API's in pentests.  I'll update with more content and revisions as I further my understanding.

 To get the most out of this mindmap it's recommended you download the mindmap file.  Then you can 
 - copy n paste queries and cmds included
 - goto links for tools
 - add your own content
 - edit the mindmap visually to your personal satisfaction
 - rearrange the order of the flow

 #### The mindmap is meant to be followed from top downward.  
 - Starting with the mindset to find GraphQL api's
 - First queries to identify 
   * type of API running
   * if introspection is enabled
   * what queries, mutations and subscriptions are available
   * deeper details on info above
 - Mapping the API
 - Then testing for vulnerabilities.
   * Auth testing
   * Injections.

> Hopefully this will help you develop a workflow for testing GraphQL for vulnerabilities.  Pentests can be overwhelming when the scope is big.  API's can be overwhelming when there are a lot of endpoints and all the pieces are connected in various ways.  This should help you
> - stay focused
> - work through a checklist
> - keep things visually understandable
> - check things are not missed or overlooked.

So happy hacking!
